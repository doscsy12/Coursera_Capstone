# Introduction

Access to health care services is important in maintaining health, preventing/ managing disease, and reducing premature death. This means that availability and timely use of primary health services is needed; Having close access to needed health care services (or geographic availability) is one factor in achieving a successful outcome for ill patients.

# Problem:

A person suddenly falls ill with symptoms similar to flu, yet he/she cannot be sure it is not covid19. Given the current health, he/she cannot wait for a doctorâ€™s appointment, but the emergency services/ hospitals might not be necessary (yet!). In such an event, would this person have quick access to a primary health service (in a specific borough/ neighbourhood) to get a primary diagnosis?

# Justification:

Firstly, since I am in healthcare, this is an issue that is important to me. Secondly, a person may just have the cold/flu since it is flu season after all. However, the country/ state does not want everybody with flu-like symptoms to overwhelm emergency services/ hospitals. So, it is important to know where the primary care providers are in each borough/ neighbourhood, and to ensure that people from that borough/ neighbourhood have access to those facilities first. Then, they can be transferred to hospitals/emergency services, if necessary.

# Aim:

The aim of this small study is to determine if residents in a borough would have quick access to primary health services in their respective neighbourhood.
